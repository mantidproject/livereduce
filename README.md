Configuration
-------------

The configuration is automatically read from `/etc/livereduce.conf`unless specified as a command line argument.
Defaults will be attempted to be determined from the environment.
A minimal configuration to specify using nightly builds of mantid installed in a conda environment `mantid-dev` is
```json
{
  "instrument": "PG3",
  "CONDA_ENV": "mantid-dev"
}
```
For testing a configuration file can be supplied as a command line argument when running
```shell
$ python scripts/livereduce.py ./livereduce.conf
```
If the instrument is not defined in the configuration file (default is `/etc/livereduce.conf`) the software will ask mantid for the default instrument using `mantid.kerel.ConfigService.getInstrument()` ([docs](https://docs.mantidproject.org/nightly/api/python/mantid/kernel/ConfigServiceImpl.html#mantid.kernel.ConfigServiceImpl.getInstrument)).
The default instrument is controlled in the [mantid properties files](https://docs.mantidproject.org/nightly/concepts/PropertiesFile.html) and is typically defined in `/etc/mantid.local.properties`.


Managing the service
--------------------

If run from inside `systemctl`, use the standard commands for starting and stopping it.
```shell
sudo systemctl start livereduce
sudo systemctl stop livereduce
sudo systemctl restart livereduce
```
The status of the service can be found via
```shell
sudo systemctl status livereduce status
```

Logging
--------

The logfile of what was setup for running, as well as other messages, is
`/var/log/SNS_applications/livereduce.log` if run as the user `snsdata`,
or `livereduce.log` in the current working directory (if run from the
command line).

the logs are stored in `/var/log/SNS_applications/livereduce.log` and are readable by anyone.
People with extra permissions can run ``sudo journalctl -u livereduce -f`` and see all of the logs without them flushing on restart of the service.
Sometimes the service refuses to restart, in that case `stop` then `start` it in separate commands.


Service scripts
---------------

Upon starting the service, script [livereduce.sh](../scripts/livereduce.sh) will be run.
This shell script invokes [livereduce.py](../scripts/livereduce.py) within a conda environment
specified in the configuration file. Otherwise the environment is set to `"mantid-dev"`.

The `livereduce.py` script manages live data reduction using the Mantid framework. It configures
logging, handles signals for graceful termination, reads the configuration JSON, and
manages live data processing with Mantid's StartLiveData and MonitorLiveData algorithms. The
script monitors memory usage and restarts the live data processing if memory limits are exceeded.
It uses pyinotify to watch for changes in configuration and processing scripts, restarting the
live data processing as needed. The script relies on instrument-specific processing scripts for data
accumulation and reduction, namely:

* `<script_dir>/reduce_<instrument>_proc.py` is the processing script for each chunk. This is required.
* `<script_dir>/reduce_<instrument>_post_proc.py` is the post-processing script for the accumulated data.
  To disable this step rename the python script so it is not found by the daemon.

Example filenames for NOMAD with default script location is
`/SNS/NOM/shared/livereduce/reduce_NOM_live_proc.py` and
`/SNS/NOM/shared/livereduce/reduce_NOM_live_post_proc.py`.


Behavior
--------

The daemon will immediately cancel
[StartLiveData](http://docs.mantidproject.org/nightly/algorithms/StartLiveData-v1.html)
and
[MonitorLiveData](http://docs.mantidproject.org/nightly/algorithms/MonitorLiveData-v1.html)
and restart them when one of processing scripts is changed (verified
by md5sum) or removed. This is to be resilient against changes in the scripts.

The process will exit and systemd will restart it if the configuration
file is changed. This is done in case the version of mantid wanted is
changed.


Building and packaging
----------------------

Testing is described in the `test/` subdirectory.

This package uses a hand-written spec file for releasing on rpm based systems rather than the one generated by python. To run it execute

```
./rpmbuild.sh
```

And look for the results in the `dist` directory.

This package depends on
[pyinotify](https://github.com/seb-m/pyinotify) and (of course)
[mantid](http://www.mantidproject.org).

Developer notes
---------------

This repository is configured to use pre-commit. This can be done using conda via

```
conda env create  # looks at environment.yml
pre-commit install
```

Python 3 compatibility
----------------------

`livereduce.py` is python2/3 compatible. Because
the [`livereduce.service`](livereduce.service) file is written to use
system python, whether it is actually using python 2 or 3 will depend
on your system's default python. The other thing to note, is that
`livereduce.py` imports mantid directly in its namespace so you must
run `livereduce.py` using the same python that mantid was built
against.
