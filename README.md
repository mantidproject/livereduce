Configuration and logging
-------------------------

The configuration is automatically read from `/etc/livereduce.conf`
unless specified as a command line argument. Defaults will be
attempted to be determined from the environment. A minimal configuration to specify using nightly builds of mantid is
```json
{
  "instrument": "PG3",
  "mantid_loc": "/opt/mantidnightly/bin"
}
```
For testing a configuration file can be supplied as a command line argument.

The logfile is `/var/log/SNS_applications/livereduce.log` if run as
the user `snsdata`, or `livereduce.log` in the current working
directory (if run from the command line).


Building and packaging
----------------------

This package uses a hand-written spec file for releasing on rpm based systems rather than the one generated by python. To run it execute

```
./buildrpm
```

And look for the results in the `dist` directory.

This package depends on
[pyinotify](https://github.com/seb-m/pyinotify) and (of course)
[mantid](http://www.mantidproject.org).
